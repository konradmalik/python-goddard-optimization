# Goddard's Rocket Problem

### My project on Optimization and Optimal Control
#### Konrad Malik

## The most general problem statement:

This problem concerns controlling a rocket's thrust in such a way that it will archive the greatest height. There is no contraint on time and in the whole case just a one (vertical) direction is taken into consideration. 

Please note that github renders latex in ipynb in a different way than local jupyter. One issue that I noticed is that equations are wrongly numbered when viewing my notebook on github.

## Required packages:
OpenGoddard, numpy, matplotlib
