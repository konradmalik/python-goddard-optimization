# Goddard's Rocket Problem

### My project on Optimization and Optimal Control
#### Konrad Malik

## The most general problem statement:

This problem concerns controlling a rocket's thrust in such a way that it will archive the greatest height. There is no contraint on time and in the whole case just a one (vertical) direction is taken into consideration. 

## Required packages:
OpenGoddard, numpy, matplotlib
